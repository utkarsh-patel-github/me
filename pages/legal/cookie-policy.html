                    <p>Small graphic images (also known as "pixel tags" or "clear GIFs") that may be included on our website and that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behavior.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
                    <p>Technologies like HTML5 localStorage and indexedDB that provide similar functionality to cookies but can store larger amounts of data and persist after you close your browser.</p>
